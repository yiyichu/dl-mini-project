This code is highly based on [kuangliu/pytorch-cifar](https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar). The modification are specified by the comments in ```main.py``` file and ```models/restnet.py```. Please referred to the report for detail modification.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.0+

## Training
Train the model with the following comment:
```
python main.py
```
By default it will run our best models, which achieves 94.58% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10, with a total 2797610 of parameters.

## Additional Experiments
Parts of our results are obtained from the ```NumLayers.ipynb```
